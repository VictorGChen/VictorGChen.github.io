## Overview

Research project contributing to the Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP), focusing on spatial transcriptomics analysis and cellular mapping in human tissues.

## Project Focus

This project involves analyzing high-dimensional spatial transcriptomics data to understand cellular organization and gene expression patterns across different tissue types. The research aims to contribute to comprehensive atlases of human tissues at the cellular level.

## Key Components

- **Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis**: Processing and analyzing spatially-resolved RNA sequencing data
- **Cellular Mapping**: Identifying and characterizing cell types based on gene expression profiles
- **Data Integration**: Combining multiple datasets to build comprehensive tissue maps
- **Computational Pipeline Development**: Creating reproducible workflows for spatial data analysis

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Bioinformatics libraries (scanpy, squidpy, anndata)
- Spatial data visualization tools
- Statistical analysis and machine learning

## Research Goals

Contributing to the broader scientific community's understanding of human tissue organization by developing computational methods for spatial omics data analysis.
