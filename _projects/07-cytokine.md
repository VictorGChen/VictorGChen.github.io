## Overview

Computational research project analyzing cytokine signaling networks to understand immune system communication and regulation. This work focuses on mapping cytokine-receptor interactions and their downstream effects on cellular behavior.

## Project Objectives

- **Network Reconstruction**: Building comprehensive maps of cytokine-receptor interactions
- **Pathway Analysis**: Identifying key signaling cascades and regulatory mechanisms
- **Data Integration**: Combining transcriptomics, proteomics, and literature-based knowledge
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developing models to predict cellular responses to cytokine stimulation

## Technical Approach

### Data Sources
- Public omics databases (GEO, TCGA)
- Curated protein-protein interaction databases
- Literature-derived cytokine-receptor binding data

### Analysis Methods
- Network analysis and graph theory
- Differential gene expression analysis
- Pathway enrichment analysis
- Machine learning for response prediction

## Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, networkx, scipy)
- R (Bioconductor packages)
- Statistical modeling
- Network visualization tools

## Research Impact

Understanding cytokine signaling networks has important implications for:
- Immune disorder therapeutics
- Cancer immunotherapy
- Inflammatory disease treatment
- Personalized medicine approaches
